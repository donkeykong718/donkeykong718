### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

A little bit about me: 

 - ðŸ’¯ I'm great at: systems and structures, attention to detail, putting out fires, stepping into leadership roles when needed, following instructions, general competence, just sitting down and doing the damn thing, word games
 - ðŸ¤¦ I'm not so great at: selling myself, using buzzwords, allowing grammatical mistakes to go unremarked upon, keeping my tongue out of my cheek, accepting compliments, basketball
 - ðŸ¤“ My tech stack includes but is not limited to: Django, Flask, Express.js, React, Next.js, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Mongoose, Node.js, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS 

 - ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a browser extention that identifies whether any given product is made with Union labor
 - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to work with AI
 - ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything
 - ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with getting a paying job
 - ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, I'm an over-sharer
